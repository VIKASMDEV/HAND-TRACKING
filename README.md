# Hand Tracking Module Project

![Hand Tracking](hand_tracking.gif)

This repository contains a Python-based hand tracking module that uses OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe, and the time library to detect and track hands in real-time video streams or recorded videos. It's a versatile module that can be integrated into various applications, including gesture recognition, sign language interpretation, and interactive interfaces.

## Requirements

Before using the hand tracking module, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x (recommended)
- OpenCV (cv2)
- MediaPipe
- time (standard library)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe
```

# Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-tracking-module.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd hand-tracking-module
```
Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the Requirements section.

You're ready to use the hand tracking module!

# Usage
To use the hand tracking module in your project, import it as follows:

```python

 import handtrackingmodule

# Initialize the hand tracker
hand_tracker = HandTracker()

# Process a frame
frame = cv2.imread("frame.jpg")
hand_tracker.process(frame)

# Get hand landmarks
landmarks = hand_tracker.get_landmarks()
```
You can then use the landmarks to perform various hand tracking and gesture recognition tasks in your application.
